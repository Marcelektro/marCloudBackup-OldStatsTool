# marCloudBackup Old Stats Collector

So my project marCloudBackup has been growing since 2019, but I've implemented a real stats system in 2024. Well, I want the stats chart to include how the project grew over the years.  
This project allowed me to reconstruct the historical usage data by analyzing chat logs from our support server (exported with [DiscordChatExporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter)), where we executed `mb!stats` commands quite often.


## About the project

**My first Rust project!**  
I could easily create this tool in Java or Py, but I wanted to take this project as an opportunity to try out a language I've never used for any real applications - Rust!  
:D
